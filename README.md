# Samuel Kuczynski Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### The purpose of this analysis was to help provide Louise a statistical comparison of similar campaigns performance using their launch dates & total funding. We have previously broken down a large subset of prior campaign performance's and extracted key dates and subcategories. This allowed us to dig deeper into the data to provide Louis recommendations on potential start dates and funding targets for success.

## Analysis and Challenges

### For this analysis we had to make a few manipulations to the data and create variables. We worked to create a “Percent Funded” & “Average Donation” for each campaign. This allowed to gain additional information that could lead to the reasoning on each film succeeding or failing.  Along this journey we were also able to extract multiple different parent and subcategories so we could dig deeper into categories Louise was interested in. Finally, we were able to manipulate some old date information that was coded in Unix timestamps, to convert that into a readable formation and extract each year the campaign launched in. A few screenshots linked below are some of the results from organizing & creating this data.

## Results

### We were able to come to two conclusions about the outcomes based on the Launch Date of the campaign. By far the most successful months to launch a campaign was May-Jun whilst the worst months to start a campaign is during the winter months of Nov-Dec.

### We were able to find that the most successful campaigns were when the goal was less that $5000, and that as the goal increases the number of successful outcomes in the “Play” subcategory fell off drastically.

###  Some of the limitations on this dataset would be the naming convention of the movies, there are a lot of characters in most of these films and translations from other languages. Using the VLOOKUP feature would be inconsistent with most campaigns. 

### Some of the other possible tables and graphs we could create for this would be bar graphs showing a breakdown of successful outcomes based on some of the other attributes in this data such as country, categories, or year.
